This is a semester long individual project for a class.

In this project I have learned how to use the MVC pattern proficiently. 
I used MongoDB to serve as the database, I also used Node.js, HTML and CSS for this project.

How to run:
1. Download the ZIP file
2. Open it with your choice of a IDE
3. Type in either npm install or npm i into the terminal (this will download the imports that are needed to run this program)
4. Type in either nodemon app or node app.js in the terminal (depending on if you have nodemon installed on your IDE)
5. Open up either chrome or firefox, and then type in localhost:3000
